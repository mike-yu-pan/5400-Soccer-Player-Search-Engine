# FIFA Player Information Retrieval System

We created a website for FIFA players to quickly access a player's statistics information and their latest news. The system runs on Google BigQuery and Cloud storage so it is lightening fast. The system also created a data pipeline that will automatically update the news information about a player every time the user use the system.
